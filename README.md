# My Automation Scripts Repository

This repository contains a collection of custom scripts for managing Servers, AWS, Google CloudDNS, and other services. The scripts are written in various languages, including Bash, Python, Powershell, and etc.

## My Scripts Naming Conventions

- Uses meaningful names that describe the purpose of the script.
- Uses lowercase letters for all script names.
- Uses underscores (_) to separate words in the script name.
- Includes the appropriate file extension for the script language (e.g. `.sh` for bash scripts, `.py` for Python scripts, `.ps1` for Powershell scripts).
- Avoided using special characters in script names.
